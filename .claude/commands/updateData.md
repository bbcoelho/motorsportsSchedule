# Update data.json file

This command allows automatic updating of race schedules without manual data entry.

## Steps

1. Use WebSearch tool to find the next upcoming MotoGP race information:
   1. Search at MotoGP official web site: https://www.motogp.com/en/calendar
   2. Identify the next race from today's date  
   3. In the next race page, identify the information to update data.json file
    - "date": is the Grand Prix date and place. For Czechia race, as an exemple, it would be: "date": "Date: Sun, Jul 20 - Czech GP" 

2. Extract the following information for each category:
   - Race date and name
   - Track/circuit name
   - Qualifying time
   - Sprint race time (if applicable, use "------" if not)
   - Main race time

3. Format the data according to the existing structure in `back/data/data.json`

4. Use the Edit tool to update `back/data/data.json` with the new race information

5. Confirm the update was successful

**IMPORTANT**: Web search results are often inaccurate or incomplete. Always verify information from multiple sources and cross-reference with official websites. If uncertain about timing details, use "TBC" (To Be Confirmed) rather than incorrect information.

**Reference Example (July 2025):**
